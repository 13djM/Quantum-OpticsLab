## 🔬 About the Group

The **Theoretical Quantum Optics Lab** at IIT Mandi investigates the fundamental physics of quantum systems and their applications in modern technologies. Our research bridges the gap between **fundamental cavity quantum electrodynamics (Cavity QED)** and practical **solid-state quantum photonics**. 

We explore the boundaries of light-matter interaction, providing theoretical frameworks that underpin future scalable quantum information processing architectures and next-generation quantum devices.

## 🌌 Research Arenas

Our work is focused on several key theoretical frontiers:

- **Quantum Coherence & Lasing**: Investigating hyperradiant lasing and threshold-less coherent light generation in quantum dot-cavity systems.
- **Semiconductor Quantum Optics**: Studying phonon-induced control mechanisms and arbitrary vector beam generation in solid-state platforms.
- **Quantum Entanglement**: Exploring the generation of high-fidelity entangled states for quantum networks and secure communication.
- **Quantum Measurement Theory**: Probing weak values and sub-shot-noise metrology.
- **Quantum Information Theory**: Developing frameworks for discrete-time quantum walks and algorithmic advantages.
